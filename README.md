# RTB-rs
A simple cross-platform windowing and event library for rust audio plugins. It does not directly provide a GUI but will allow other libraries to be built upon it which do. It is similar to the winit project, but geared toward the specific needs of audio plugins which are quite different to the goals of winit.

This project is a work in progress.

If you wish to contribute, or wish to read more detailed information about this library and related topics please check the [wiki](https://github.com/rust-dsp/rust-vst/wiki/Rust-Audio-GUI-Development-Progress).

To run the standalone window example, run:
```bash
cargo run --example window
```
